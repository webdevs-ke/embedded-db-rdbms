### Angular
Angular is a prominent open-source web application framework developed and maintained by Google. As of January 2026, it is a leading platform for building scalable, high-performance single-page applications (SPAs) using TypeScript.

#### Core Characteristics
1. Component-Based Architecture: Applications are built as a hierarchy of modular components, which are classes that handle data logic and are associated with HTML templates.
2. TypeScript-Driven: It utilizes TypeScript to provide static typing, which helps catch errors during development and improves code maintainability.
3. Modern Reactivity: The framework recently introduced Signals, a system for fine-grained state management that optimizes rendering updates for better performance.
4. Comprehensive Toolset: Unlike libraries that focus only on the UI, Angular is "opinionated" and includes built-in solutions for:
    - Routing: Managing navigation between different views.
    - Forms: Tools for handling complex user input and validation.
    - HTTP Client: A robust system for communicating with backend servers.
    - Dependency Injection: A design pattern used to increase efficiency and modularity.

#### Recent Developments (2025–2026)
Angular v21: Released in early 2026, this version introduced Signal Forms, enhanced AI-powered workflows via the Angular MCP Server, and expanded support for spread operators in templates.
1. AI Integration: The framework now emphasizes "agentic workflows," allowing developers to use tool calling APIs to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) directly into their web apps.
2. Standalone APIs: Modern versions have shifted away from "NgModules" in favor of standalone components, simplifying the initial learning curve and reducing boilerplate code.

#### Getting Started
To begin developing with Angular, you typically need to install Node.js and the Angular CLI, which is the command-line tool used to create, build, and test applications. Official documentation and interactive tutorials can be found at https://angular.dev

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.3.8.
